# tdd-go

## Story behind

I am in the process of learning, building a Go based API backend.
While doing so, I have come across the concept of Test-Driven-Development quite a lot of times, and some google searches later I came across this repo by Chris James @quii -> [quii/Learn Go With Tests](https://github.com/quii/learn-go-with-tests) and when is better than now to learn TDD!
